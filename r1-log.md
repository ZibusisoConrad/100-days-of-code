<!-- ### R1D1  -->

### Day 1: August 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: start frontend mentor [stats-preview-card](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62) challenge file setup , fix gulp errors, 100dayofcode log

**Thoughts**: I manually typed in the @codercoder gulpfile.js to better understand how it works. like a noob i commited and push files without testing if the code works. also setup this log for my #100daysofcode

**Today's Progress**: finished mobile version of frontend mentor [stats-preview-card](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62), deployed project on vercel

**Thoughts**: still need to learn how to name classes, maybe i will check out th e BEM thing. kkkkk turns out you need the dist folder when u deploy, had to remove it from git ignore.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
